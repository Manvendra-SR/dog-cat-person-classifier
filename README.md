# 🐶🐱🧍 Dog vs Cat vs Person - Image Classifier

This is a deep learning mini project that classifies an input image as either a **dog**, **cat**, or **person** using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **PyTorch**.  
The model is deployed using a clean **Gradio** interface for real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom CNN architecture
- ✅ Trained on a custom dataset (dog, cat, person)
- ✅ Prediction via saved `.pth` model
- ✅ Gradio web UI for easy testing
- ✅ Clean, simple Python-based deployment

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is trained using:
- Convolutional layers (with ReLU)
- MaxPooling layers
- Fully Connected layers
- Final softmax for 3-class classification

Trained with PyTorch and saved as `model.pth`.
